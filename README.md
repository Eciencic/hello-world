# hello-world
#Just my first repository
#I'm really new to this, I really want to learn how to code therefore I'm making a github account and completing the first tutorial "Hello World"
#Today is normal monday of october, the 22th to be more accurate.
#I just finished all the task assigned to me at my first "Real" job at ICV (Ingenieria Civil Vicente), and I'm really bored cause I'm waiting for Don Pedro Vicente to arrive and give me the "Santiago" pass or more tasks until I finish my contract, remaining util the 31st of this month.
